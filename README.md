# AutoRAG Finder

Standalone Electron + React desktop app for the public AutoRAG librarian.

## Prerequisites

- Bun
- Node.js 24+
- Rust and `dupey` (`cargo install dupey --locked`)

The librarian is not vendored and is never read from a sibling checkout. Before
install, development, tests, typechecking, or builds, the lifecycle scripts
clone or fast-forward `.upstream/autorag` to `origin/main`, install its
dependencies, and build its `dist` output. The sync prints the exact upstream
HEAD used by the app. It only uses the public GitHub repository; corpus files
and secrets stay local.

## Commands

From a fresh clone, run `make setup` once: it verifies the toolchain (bun,
Node 24+, dupey), installs dependencies, and makes the checkout ready for
development. It is idempotent, so re-running it is always safe.

```sh
make setup
make run
bun run test
bun run typecheck
bun run build
```

Equivalent manual commands (what `make setup` wraps):

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
node scripts/ensure-electron.mjs
bun run dev
```

`make run` also works from a fresh clone on its own: it runs a fast `--ensure`
preflight that installs dependencies only when `node_modules` is missing, then
launches the app. Run `make setup` explicitly when you want the toolchain
checks (a missing `dupey` fails loudly there instead of at launch).

`make run` starts the dev app on free ports with debugging enabled: it picks
unused ports for the renderer dev server, the main-process V8 inspector
(`chrome://inspect`), and the renderer remote-debugging endpoint, and prints
all three before launching. It goes through `bun run dev`, so the `predev`
hooks fast-forward the librarian to `origin/main` and rebuild it first: the
window always runs the latest version.

Set `AUTORAG_SKIP_DUPEY_CHECK=1` only when intentionally testing without
version-family support. Use `PORT=9234 bun run dev` to select the Vite port.

## Live filesystem sync

Folders shown in open tabs are watched for changes made by other apps. A
created, deleted, renamed, or edited file appears in the tab without clicking
anything. Ordinary direct-child changes are applied incrementally: the main
process re-reads only the changed paths and the renderer patches those rows.
An event overflow, a recreated watched root, or a missing-path recovery falls
back to a full relist. Only real folders in open tabs are watched: Recents,
Contacts, and datasource virtual paths never are. Watching uses
`@parcel/watcher`; symlinked folders are canonicalized for native events and
mapped back to the path shown in the tab. Events are coalesced per directory
with a 150 ms trailing debounce and a 1 s maximum wait. Closing a tab,
navigating away, reloading the window, or quitting releases the watches. Set
`AUTORAG_FS_WATCH_DIAG=1` to log watch, unwatch, and batch diagnostics.

All live traffic flows through one serial `ChangeHub` queue in the main
process. For each batch, every registered derived layer reconciles first, with
a 750 ms per-layer timeout, and only then does the hub send a single ordered
`live:message` push. Layers are always reconciled before the view updates. The
renderer holds a per-layer fence: until the dupey layer has reconciled a batch,
its rows are shown flat instead of stacked, so the list and the version stacks
never disagree. Focusing the window or making it visible re-syncs the listing
and layers through `live:layers`.

Adding a derived layer needs no new IPC channel. Implement `DerivedLayer` in
the main process:

```ts
import type { DerivedLayer } from "./change-hub";
import type { FsDirChange } from "../shared/live-contract";

const myLayer: DerivedLayer<MyData> = {
	id: "my-layer",
	snapshot: () => service.result(),           // current published data
	applyChanges: (dirs: readonly FsDirChange[]) => service.applyDirChanges(dirs),
	resync: () => service.reverify(),           // optional full re-derivation
};
```

Register it in `src/main/index.ts` where the hub is created
(`hub.register(myLayer)`), and add a selector in
`src/renderer/src/state/layers.ts`. Publications ride the existing
`live:message` push and the `live:layers` resync.

Explicit non-goals: live events never trigger a dupey rescan, so a new or
edited file joins version stacks at the next regular scan. A stack member whose
content changed after the scan is shown as a normal row (detached) until the
next scan. An external rename of a stack member re-points the stack within a 2 s
window. Search results are not live.

## Manual QA

The Finder QA scripts are under `scripts/manual-qa/`. Build first, then run a
script with `bun scripts/manual-qa/run-qa-finder-<topic>.mjs`. Evidence belongs
under `.omo/evidence/ai-finder-app/` and is ignored.
